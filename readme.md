# Task-Tracker

Task tracker cli done with the intention of filling some personal gaps with Go programming language and applying a few OOP concepts with this language.
the goal was to completely rawdog this cli, without AI help or anything, my purpose was testing if i still know how to code without an assistant, that felt very challenging at the beginning, but the pieces started coming together as time went on

done that in two days, perhaps some code is very ugly. my intent is to come back here later to apply some design-patterns in the future (or not)
